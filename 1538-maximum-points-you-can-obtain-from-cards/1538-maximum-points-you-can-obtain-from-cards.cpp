    /* Intuition for reframing the problem
    By reframing the problem to find the contiguous subarray of length \U0001d45b âˆ’ \U0001d458
    with the minimum sum, you've transformed it into a fixed sliding window
    problem

    The minimum sum found within these windows tells you which block to leave
    behind, so that the sum of the removed cards (which is the total sum minus
    this minimum sum) is maximized.
