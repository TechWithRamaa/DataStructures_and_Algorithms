    /* Why this intuition ?
    Instead of directly computing the time using \U0001d45f Ã— \U0001d45b x n,
    we are working in reverse to determine how many cars a mechanic can repair within a given time. 
    
    This is needed because we are using binary search on time,
    checking whether a given time is sufficient to repair all cars.
