/*
\U0001f539 Problem Summary:
    Youâ€™re given a list of events where each event has:
    startDay, endDay, and value.
    You can attend at most k non-overlapping events.

    Goal: Maximize the total value of the events attended.

\U0001f539 Approach: DP + Binary Search (on end time)
    This is a classic DP on sorted intervals problem. For each event, you decide:
    Take it and move to the next non-overlapping event.
    Skip it and try the next.

\U0001f539 Steps:
    Sort the events by start time.
    Use DP[i][k] to represent the maximum value using events from i onward with k picks left.
    Use binary search to jump to the next non-overlapping event.
